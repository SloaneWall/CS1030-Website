        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of hobbies! So many, in fact, that I often have friends joke that my main hobby is collecting
            hobbies. They're probably not wrong. So, what do I like to do?</p>

        <p>As far as music goes, I will listen to just about everything, but I have a soft spot for <a
                href="https://systemofadown.com/" target="_blank">System of a Down</a> and <a
                href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank">Tool</a>. Wait, not that tool. <a
                href="https://www.toolband.com/" target="_blank">this one</a>. Both were favorites when I was in high
            school and are still influential in my music tastes today.</p>
