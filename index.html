        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of hobbies! So many, in fact, that I often have friends joke that my main hobby is collecting
            hobbies. They're probably not wrong. So, what do I like to do?</p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>As far as music goes, I will listen to just about everything, but I have a soft spot for <a
                href="https://systemofadown.com/" target="_blank">System of a Down</a> and <a href="./tool.html"
                target="_blank">Tool</a>. Wait, not that tool. <a href="https://www.toolband.com/" target="_blank">this
                one</a>. Both were favorites when I was in high
            school and are still influential in my music tastes today.
        </p>
        <p>I'm more than a little obsessed with my dog, Bronx!
        </p>
        <img id="bronx" src="assets\images\sad_bronx.jpg" />
        <p>Isn't he adorable? He's not a fan of me studying and not giving him attention. I adopted him at the end of
            2021. We aren't sure what breed he is, but he's high energy and <em>just a little guy.</em></en>
        </p>
        <p>I am currently in my very first semester pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Network
            Management at Weber State University. I am planning to use my degree to advance my current career in
            renewable energy.</p>
